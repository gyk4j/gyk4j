Old-time developer who have learned many programming languages and technologies from school and work. Far too many to 
remember every single detail, syntax, runtime library API call since the eon of time. And far too many to become
proficient in all of them.

As a traditionalist trained in the classical school of *Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)*, 
I have spent a lifetime with ☕ **Java** since its beginning, which explains my unhealthy fascination with 📚 
*GoF Design Pattern* &mdash; despite its obsolescence by the 🎛️ *Inversion of Control* &mdash; and tendency for 
over-engineering to make software modular, reusable and extensible. 

However, new Java language features in recent years that break the original design rules, and the shortcomings of JVM, 
have caused me to explore newer technologies like Golang.

A strict adherent of 🌉 *cross-platform development* to avoid unnecessary 🔓 vendor lock-in.

I also had a few jobs that took me to the Microsoft's world of **C#, .NET and ASP.NET**.

In my free time, I can be found tending to my repositories on GitHub with tender loving care, savouring tech 
videos on Linux and DevOps.
