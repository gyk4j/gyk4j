Old-time developer who have learned many programming languages and technologies from school and work. Far too many to 
remember every single detail, syntax, runtime library API call since the eon of time. And far too many to become
proficient in all of them.

As a traditionalist, fundamentalist and strict adherent trained in the classical school of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), 
I have spent a lifetime with ☕ Java since its beginning, which explains my unhealthy fascination and tendency for studying 
and thinking about 📚 *GoF Design Pattern* despite its obsolescence by the 🎛️ *Inversion of Control*.

The focus on 🌉 *cross-platform development* is also a core belief of mine to avoid 🔓 vendor lock-in.

I also had a few jobs that took me to the Microsoft's world of C#, .NET and ASP.NET.

In my free time, I can be found tending to my repositories on GitHub with tender loving care, savouring tech 
videos on Linux and DevOps.
